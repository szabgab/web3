# Web 3.0

Web3 or Web 3.0 is the name people use to describe the "next generation" of the Internet (or that of the Web on the Internet). Whatever that means.

Many years ago  [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), who invented the Web had a vision called [Semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). That too was referred to as Web 3.0,
but these days people who use the term Web 3.0 usually refer to something else.

The original hope of the web was decentralization and democratization.

* Web 1.0 was the corporation generated content.
* Web 2.0 is the user generated content, where everyone can write a blog post, record a podcast or a video. Unfortunatelly that content is hosted on a very limited number of platforms and and an even more limited number of companies control what will the people find. Despite the hope of democratization and empowering the individuals what we have is a rather centralized network of content.
* Web 3.0 in the current form of the dream is another attempt at decentralization.
