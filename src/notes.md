# Notes

Notes as I am learning Blockchain / Etherum / Web 3.

I am not even sur what should be the title of this "book", what is the main topic here.

A [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger).


## Questions

* How can I use cryptocurrency as a plain user?

* Popular vote, but how is it really protected agains bad actors? Especiall bad state actors that might create many nodes?
* How many nodes are in popular chains?
* What is the size of each node? In terms of data storage and computation power?
* How to set up my own node and how to join a network and why is it even interesting?
* How to set up my own chain and why to do that?


* Rollups:optimistic and zk
* Gas cost
* Upchain
* Orbit chains
* [Binance Square](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/22818689469889)
* [Ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io/) - Etherum Token Explorer



## Topics to cover/answer

* Blockchain development tools such as revm, reth, geth, Remix, etc.
* EVM execution engine.
* Design, develop, and deploy innovative smart contracts and protocols on Ethereum.
* Solidity and Ethereum smart contract development.
* Layer-2 solutions, such as Rollups or state channels.




* Etherum is the blockchain it is a decentralized, open-source blockchain.
* dApps  (distributed apps using smart contracts)
* Ether or ETH is the cryptocurrency on top of it

* Original author [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin)

* There are several Etherum networks (e.g. for development) and then there is the MainNet

* ERC-20 token standard of Ethereum - many other cryptocurrencies use it. (e.g. [Nano](https://nano.org/en) ?, Red ?)
* [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

* NFTs - Non-fungible tokens

* Proof of Work
* Proof of Stake


1. What is Blockchain?
1. How does Blockchain work?
1. What is Etherum and how does that work?
1. Learn Solidity to build Smart Contracts

Solidity runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
    * Install locally or try it on the web with Remix

VS Code Solidity plugin by Juan Blanco?
