# Etherum

## Topic to cover/answer

* Blockchain development tools such as revm, reth, geth, Remix, etc.
* EVM execution engine.
* Design, develop, and deploy innovative smart contracts and protocols on Ethereum.
* Solidity and Ethereum smart contract development.
* Layer-2 solutions, such as Rollups or state channels.




* Etherum is the blockchain it is a decentralized, open-source blockchain.
* dApps  (distributed apps using smart contracts)
* Ether or ETH is the cryptocurrency on top of it

* Original author [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin)

* There are several Etherum networks (e.g. for development) and then there is the MainNet

* ERC-20 token standard of Ethereum - many other cryptocurrencies use it. (e.g. [Nano](https://nano.org/en) ?, Red ?)
* [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

* NFTs - Non-fungible tokens

* Proof of Work
* Proof of Stake


* Blockchains
* [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) the programming language for Smart contracts

1. How does Blockchain work?
1. What is Etherum and how does that work?
1. Learn Solidity to build Smart Contracts

Solidity runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
    * Install locally or try it on the web with Remix

VS Code Solidity plugin by Juan Blanco?

## Blockchain layers

### Layer 0

* Hardware (the nodes, computers participating in the network)
* Mining equipment??? Proof of Work - PoW

### Layer 1

* Distributed public ledger, blocks, [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)
